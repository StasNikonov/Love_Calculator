      <p>Welcome to this great invention of Doctor Love!</p>
      <p>
        We all know that a name can tell a lot about a person. Names are not
        randomly chosen: they all have a meaning. Doctor Love knew this so he
        made another great invention just for the lonely you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you'd like to know if a relationship with someone could work
        out. Therefore Doctor Love himself designed this great machine for you.
        With The Love Calculator you can calculate the probability of a
        successful relationship between two people. The Love Calculator is an
        affective way to get an impression of what the chances are on a
        relationship between two people.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find out what the chances for you and your dream partner are, just
        fill in both full names (both first and last name) in the two text boxes
        below, and press Calculate.
      </p>
